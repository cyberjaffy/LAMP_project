# WEB Stack Implementation (L.A.M.P Stack in AWS)

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set up a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on an AWS EC2 t2.micro instance with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for a DevOps project.



## Prerequisites

1. Install Windows Terminal
2. Open an AWS account and provision an Ubuntu server
3. SSH key pair for EC2 instance
## Step 1 - Get your instance up and running

1. Sign up to AWS console following this [instruction](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
2. After successfully signing up, launch a new instance.

3. Select a region close to you and launch an instance of t2.micro family with Linux ubuntu server.
4. Create a new .pem priavte key(If you don't have one already) and save it securely.
5. Configure your security groups by ensuring that the following ports are allowed:

   SSH (port 22) – for remote access
   
   HTTP (port 80) – for web traffic
   
   HTTPS (port 443) – for secure web traffic (optional)

6. Launch your ec2 instance

## Step 2 - Connect to the ec2 instance via ssh
      
1. Open your Windows terminal tool and navigate to your downloads directory

   `cd downloads`

2. Connect to the instance by running
   
   `ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@(your-ec2-public-ip)`

 Now, you're connected to your ec2 instance via ssh

## Step 3 - Install Apache and update the firewall

1. Install Apache using Ubuntu's package manager 'apt'. 
Run the following commands

`sudo apt update`
    
 ![image 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e935353-ebac-497b-8d59-6a66517f15f6)


`sudo apt install apache2`

2. To verify apache is running, run this command

   `sudo systemctl status apache2`

 ![image 9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b464ae-e64c-4f99-b524-53a1340a4e7c)

3. Now that your server is running, check it via http://(your-ec2-public-ip)

Congrats! you've just launched your first web browser in the clouds.
    
## Step 4 - Install MySQL

1. To Install MySQL:
   
   `sudo apt install mysql-server -y`

    ![image 11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b133fc23-c9f0-44eb-958a-5fe3ba6d7c96)


2. Secure MySQL installation:
   
   `sudo mysql` 

3. It is recommended that you run a script that comes pre-installed with MySQL. This script will remove some insecure default and lockdown access to your database system.

   `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';`

     ![image 12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38a03a64-a958-4bae-825f-ff84449f1320)



4. Exit the MySQL shell:
   
   `mysql> exit`

    ![image 13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4efc1cea-1f97-453b-9829-047dda935e52)


5. Start the interactive script:
   
   `sudo mysql_secure_installation`  

    ![image 14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a174ff5-8dbd-4124-9921-d7421d75b81c)


6. You'll be prompted to change your default password to a password of your choice, remove anonymous users, disallow root logins etc. Answer y for yes or anything else to continue without enabling.

    ![image 15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8395c085-fcce-46b9-899d-31fdd1e5d22b)


7. Login into MySQL to ensure it works:
   
   `sudo mysql -p`
    
     ![image 16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a097d6f-28d7-485e-a6b5-04adf69d718f)


    Use your new password If you changed it to access MySQL server

8. Exit the MySQL console:
   
   `mysql> exit`

     ![image 17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c5965ce-63e3-4127-a49c-ffb8dceed8cc)

            
## Step 5 - Install PHP

1. Install PHP, PHP extensions for Apache and MySQL
   
   `sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php-cli -y`

     ![image 18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5a2093e-df90-4174-bc05-6a9d1a38b677)


3. Confirm your php version
   
   `php -v`

     ![image 19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d51d2c6e-7e01-4933-be8c-81b943710d74)

At this point, your L.A.M.P stack is fully installed and operational.


## Step 6 - Create a virtual host for your website using Apache

1. Create a new directory for your website(my website would be named projectlamp, you can use any name for yourself.)
   
   `sudo mkdir /var/www/projectlamp`

3. Assign ownership of the directory with the user environment variable
   
   `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectlamp`

4. Create a new config file
   
   `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/projectlamp.conf`

5. You can use the ls command to show the new file in the sites-available directory
   
   `sudo ls /etc/apache2/sites-available`

     ![image 20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d59c3476-580c-4e79-bb04-94347979643b)


6. Enable the new virtual host
   
   `sudo a2ensite projectlamp`

   ![image 21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e25908f-3ace-4cc6-a5ec-81e43d47bd99)

7. Disable Apache default website
   
   `sudo a2dissite 000-default`
   
     ![image 22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca574bd2-1a85-4396-82f7-b37466c76170)


8. Confirm your config file has zero syntax error
   
   `sudo apache2ctl configtest`

     ![image 23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc4be3e0-c6d7-442c-8721-59a26c2d714e)

9. Reload Apache so these changes can take effect
   
   `sudo systemctl reload apache2`    


Congrats! Your new website is now active, but the web root /var/www/projectlamp is still empty. You need to create an html file in that location so we can confirm that it works perfectly.

## Step 7 - Test the website with html scripts

1. Navigate to the project path
   
   `cd /var/www/projectlamp`

2. Create an index.html file
   
   `touch index.html`

3. Open the inde.html file.
   
   `nano index.html`

4. Copy the following:
   ```
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>ProjectLamp</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Welcome to Your First L.A.M.P project</h1>
          <p>This is a simple HTML file for testing purposes. If you're seeing this then it works.</p>
      </body>
   </html>
   ```
To save the index.html file, use Ctrl + S and Ctrl + X to exit


5. To view the html code you just wrote:
   
   `cat index.html`

      ![image 24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/512cc22d-b8fe-4350-995e-03523859bd54)

6. Now you view your new web page via http://(your-ec2-public-ip)    

     ![image 25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f06e4a6-eb7c-4e6f-8ae2-007d821c70ad)




## Step 8 - Enable PHP on the website

1. Add the following php code to enable php on the website
   
   `sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf`

With the default DirectoryIndex settings on Apache, a file named index.html will always take precedence over an index.php file. So we're going to edit this behavior and change the order in which the index.php file is listed in the DirectoryIndex directive.
   ```
   <IfModule mod_dir.c>
       DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm
   </IfModule>
   ```
3. After saving and closing the file, reload Apache so the changes can take effect

   `sudo systemctl reload apache2`


4. Create a new index.php file inside your custom web root folder
   
   `nano /var/www/lampproject/index.php`

6. Add the following text
   ```
   <?php
   phpinfo();
   ?>
   ```

5. After completing this, refresh your http://(your-public-ip)/info.php

   ![image 26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae757270-9fca-4888-82e6-107259a42ddb)
If you're seeing this page in your browser, It means your PHP installation is working as expected. 

6. For security reasons, remove index.php
   
   `rm index.php`

CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! you just complted your first LAMP web-stack in the cloud.
